# Duck Hub Server (With web interface)

## Info

If you don't need or want the web interface then you can disable it in the config file (json/config.json)

## Config

- MONGODB_URI: The uri to the MongoDB database that you want to use
- ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: The secret for the access token\*
- REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET: The secret for the refresh token\*

Important notes:

- refresh_token_expire_time: This variable must be a number and states the expiration time of refresh tokens in days
